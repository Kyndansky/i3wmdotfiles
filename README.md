# i3wmdotfiles
## Info
These are some of my .config configurations using linux (my distro is mint but it should work perfectly well for any other distro) with i3wm and picom (and eww for the top bar). It also includes a couple of scripts to display the wallpapers (they are displayed on 2 screens since i have 2, you can edit it to your liking)
(the wallpaper is not included so mind that the script won't work by itself) and other stuff

## Purpose
this repository's goal is to keep a backup of a relatively good config for i3wm in case i need to go back to it (i'm planning to switch to hyprland).

## Sharing
Feel free to use my configuration however you like: you can use it or edit it, i don't care

## Suggestions
i especially reccomend the picom config, as it provides good animations for window switching with trasparency effects and the eww config for a trasparent clean topbar that displays music, time and date, all workspaces, wifi icon if connected, volume and system tray apps (as well as buttons to shutdown, reboot, suspend or logout of the session).

This is the first time i share my dotfiles and i've been using linux for about a week so i'll probably changed everything if i feel it needs to be changed.
